# Linux

## The desktop app

From [Releases](https://github.com/alphaXiv/OpenResearch/releases), download
`OpenResearch-x86_64.AppImage` (or `OpenResearch-aarch64.AppImage` on ARM), make
it executable, and run it:

```sh
chmod +x OpenResearch-x86_64.AppImage
./OpenResearch-x86_64.AppImage
```

The dashboard opens in its own window. Closing the window quits OpenResearch, and
starting it again while it runs brings the window back. Each start adds
OpenResearch to your applications, so the dock and app grid show its name and
icon: `~/.local/share/applications/openresearch.desktop`, pointing at wherever the
AppImage now is, and its icon under `~/.local/share/icons`. The entry hides
itself once the AppImage is deleted; remove those two files to drop it entirely.
Keep the AppImage somewhere you can write to, such as `~/Applications`: it
updates itself by replacing that file, and Restart in the dashboard relaunches
the new version.

The AppImage bundles WebKitGTK, so it needs nothing installed beyond glibc 2.35
or newer (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora 36, and later) and `fusermount` to
mount itself. Where FUSE isn't available, run it with
`--appimage-extract-and-run`, or set `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1`.

The app starts `orx app` from inside the image. Agents find `orx` because its
folder leads their `PATH`, and because a desktop launcher doesn't read your
shell's startup files, the app asks your login shell for `PATH` and the other
variables orx cares about when it starts. The browser, file manager, editors,
terminals, and agents it opens get your session's GTK settings back, not the
AppImage's. It uses port 4792, or a free port if something else holds it.

## The CLI

The release's `openresearch-cli-<arch>-unknown-linux-musl` archives and the shell
installer are static binaries with no GUI; `orx up` opens the dashboard in your
browser.

## Known gaps

| | |
|---|---|
| Audio and video previews | WebKitGTK plays media through GStreamer, which the AppImage doesn't bundle. |
| Error dialogs | If the app can't start, it says why through `zenity` or `kdialog`, and on stderr; without either, run the AppImage from a terminal to see it. |
| Wayland | The bundled GTK runs under XWayland, as linuxdeploy's GTK plugin sets it up to. |
| HTTPS in the window | The bundled TLS reads certificates from `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`, as on Debian, Ubuntu, and Arch; on Fedora and openSUSE, HTTPS pages inside the window fail. The dashboard itself is local HTTP. |

## Releasing the app

`release-linux-app.yml` builds both AppImages from the release's commit, attaches
them, and writes `linux-app.json`, once the repository variable
`LINUX_APP_ENABLED` is `true`. Like the macOS app it follows a Release run
dispatched by a token (see `macos/DISTRIBUTION.md`); to attach the AppImages to an
existing release, dispatch the workflow with its tag. CI on every pull request
also builds, smoke-tests, and uploads both AppImages
(`openresearch-linux-<arch>-appimage`). The smoke test runs after WebKitGTK is
removed from the runner, so it fails if the image falls back to a host copy.

To build one locally on Ubuntu 22.04 or newer:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev librsvg2-dev file patchelf
cargo build --release --features desktop
scripts/build-linux-appimage.sh target/release/orx dist
```
