# Windows

Windows support is in beta. The CLI and dashboard work, including local
experiment runs and the nanochat demo. The gaps are listed at the bottom.

## Prerequisites

**Git for Windows is required**, and for more than git. It is the only source of
the `bash` and coreutils that orx uses to run experiments — the `bash.exe` in
`System32` is the WSL launcher, which cannot see your files, and orx rejects it.
Install it with the standard installer so `git.exe` lands on `PATH`; orx finds
the shell by walking up from there.

You also need a coding agent. Claude Code is the default:

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e
winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Open a new terminal afterwards so `PATH` is picked up.

The nanochat demo installs `uv`, and with it Python, on its first run.

## Install

### The desktop app

From [Releases](https://github.com/alphaXiv/OpenResearch/releases), download
`OpenResearch-Setup.exe` and run it. It installs for your account only, with no
administrator prompt, into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\OpenResearch`, adds
OpenResearch to the Start menu, and installs the Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime
if Windows lacks it. The dashboard opens in its own window; closing the window
quits OpenResearch, and starting it again while it runs brings the window back.
Running the installer or uninstaller while OpenResearch is open asks you to
close it first.

The install holds two programs. `OpenResearch.exe` is what the Start menu runs:
it starts `orx.exe app` in a hidden console, which `orx` and the git, shell, and
agent processes it starts share, so none of them flashes a window. Agents find
`orx` because its folder leads their `PATH`. `orx.exe` is the same binary as the
CLI release and updates itself the same way (below).

The app uses port 4792, or a free port if something else holds it.

### The CLI

From [Releases](https://github.com/alphaXiv/OpenResearch/releases), download
`openresearch-cli-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip`, extract it, and double-click
`orx.exe`. It starts the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:4791` and opens your
browser. Leave the console window open — closing it stops the server. If orx
cannot start, a dialog says why.

To have `orx` on your `PATH` as a command instead, run the PowerShell installer,
which installs to `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin`:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/alphaXiv/OpenResearch/releases/latest/download/openresearch-cli-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

Every install updates itself. `orx update`, or the Updates section of the
dashboard's Settings page, replaces `orx.exe` in place, and a running dashboard
offers a Restart button once the new version is on disk. The app's launcher
changes only with a new `OpenResearch-Setup.exe`.

### The SmartScreen warning

Neither `orx.exe` nor the installer is code-signed yet, so Windows shows
"Windows protected your PC" on first run. Choose **More info** → **Run anyway**.

Signing is planned, but it will not make this go away immediately: since 2024
even an EV certificate has to earn SmartScreen reputation through download
volume like any other, so early builds will keep showing the warning.

### Long paths

Windows refuses paths over 260 characters. orx passes `core.longpaths` to git
itself, but a deep repository can still defeat the agent or your experiment
scripts. If you hit "path too long" from something that is not git, enable long
paths system-wide — once, as administrator, then reboot:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem' -Name LongPathsEnabled -Value 1
```

## Known gaps

| | |
|---|---|
| `orx up --remote-host` | Refused. The control channel is a Unix domain socket. |
| Restart after an update | There is no `exec`, so a restarting `orx up` starts a new process and exits. In a terminal the prompt comes back while the server keeps running in that console, where Ctrl+C still stops it; a supervisor sees the old process exit. |
| SSH connection reuse | Windows' OpenSSH cannot multiplex, so each status or log poll opens its own connection, and the Settings page uses the most recent preflight result instead of reporting a missing multiplexed master as a disconnection. Use a key held by an agent, or one without a passphrase. |
| The PATH guard | Not applied; it needs a POSIX shell startup file. |
| Data directory | Still `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\openresearch`, not `%APPDATA%`. |
| Signing out or upgrading while the app runs | Windows ends the app at once, without stopping the agents it started or saving the last workspace state. |
| Starting the app while it is quitting | The new launch finds the old one still running and exits, so start it again once it has closed. |

## Releasing the app

`release-windows-app.yml` builds `OpenResearch-Setup.exe` from each release's
published `orx.exe` and attaches it, once the repository variable
`WINDOWS_APP_ENABLED` is `true`. Like the macOS app it follows a Release run
dispatched by a token (see `macos/DISTRIBUTION.md`); to attach the installer to
an existing release, dispatch the workflow with its tag. CI on every pull
request also uploads an `openresearch-windows-installer` artifact to test with.
